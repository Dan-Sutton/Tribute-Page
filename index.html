     <h3>Appearances and Creation</h3>
      <p>Geralt of Rivia is the protagonist of the Witcher franchise which was created by Andrzej Sapkowski. Serving as the titular deuteragonist of the novels, the protagonist of the games and as one the three main protagonists (alongside Ciri and Yennefer) of the 2019 Netflix adaptation.</p>
     <h3>Lore and abilities</h3>
       <p>He is a witcher, a magically-enhanced mutant who slays monsters for a price, and is the adopted father of Ciri. Despite the fact that witchers have a reputation for being heartless and the mutations are meant to kill emotions, Geralt still has a conscience and generally helps others because it's the right thing rather than to get paid, though he rarely goes out of his way to admit this.</p>
